      <b>Learning Saves Lives: Why we are reimagining workforce training</b><br>
      <i>By Wesley Morris, iTELL CEO</i><br><br>
      Fifteen years ago, a conversation around a bonfire changed my life.<br><br>
      My cousin, a young Army lieutenant on leave from Iraq, was wrestling with a tragedy. 
      He was an intelligence officer whose job was to plan safe convoy routes through Baghdad. 
      He'd identified a particularly dangerous stretch of broken terrain and issued a clear warning: "drive carefully."<br><br>
      This critical warning was buried in a dense, text-heavy PowerPoint slide deck.<br><br>
      The young soldiers who received it, being 18-20 years old, likely skimmed it or ignored it completely. 
      Tragically, one soldier, on a reckless joyride, flipped his vehicle and died.<br><br>
      A life was lost, not due to a failure of planning, but a failure of communication. 
      The training materials were obsolete, unable to engage or hold attention. 
      My cousin was exonerated, but the guilt and responsibility for that lost life haunts him to this day. 
      He carries that soldier's name with him, every single day, as a reminder of his responsibility to the people 
      under his command.<br><br>
      <b>Building the Mission of iTELL</b><br><br>
      That tragedy never left me. 
      As I built my career in education, I kept asking: <i>How can we communicate vital procedures in a way that actually works?</i> 
      How do we not just present information, but ensure it is understood and remembered?<br><br>
      We need a way to make learning <b>engaging, interactive, and accountable</b>. 
      A tool that doesn't just inform, but protects. It could get people ready for work faster, 
      keep them safer, and prevent the kind of accidents that, in the US alone, cost 18 million workdays every year.<br><br>
      This mission drove me to pursue my PhD, and it converged perfectly with the AI revolution. 
      With the advent of transformative AI models, the impossible suddenly seemed within reach.<br><br>
      That convergence is why we built iTELL.<br><br>
      <b>How iTELL Transforms Training</b><br><br>
      iTELL uses AI to solve the very problem my cousin faced. 
      We automatically convert those static, easy-to-skip documents—PowerPoints, PDFs, manuals—into dynamic, 
      interactive learning experiences.<br><br>
      Think of it like this: we turn a wall of text into a conversation.<br>
      <ul>
          <li><b>It's Interactive:</b> Our AI generates built-in activities like short quizzes and fill-in-the-blank exercises to reinforce understanding as you learn.</li>
          <li><b>It's Accountable:</b> We measure a learner's knowledge and engagement in real-time, giving instructors actionable data to see who is truly prepared.</li>
          <li><b>It's Plug-and-Play:</b> iTELL can integrate with the learning management system you already have, or using single-sign-on from Google or Outlook.</li>
      </ul>
      <b>This Isn't Just a Dream—It's Here</b><br><br>
      We've already moved from a powerful story to a proven solution. 
      iTELL's MVP has been deployed in 10 instructional settings across 4 trade schools and universities. 
      The results are clear: improved learning and higher user satisfaction. 
      Our findings aren't just internal; they're validated in eight peer-reviewed publications.<br><br>
      Now, with the support of the NSF I-Corps program, we're bringing this transformation to industry.<br><br>
      <b>Join Us on This Mission</b><br><br>
      When I think about iTELL's future, I still go back to that bonfire. 
      I remember the stakes. This isn't just about efficiency or cost savings for companies—though we will deliver that. 
      It's about preventing the kind of tragedy that my cousin, and that soldier's family, lived through.<br><br>
      We are building tools that don't just train better; they protect people.<br><br>
      We are proud to be making this dream a reality, and we invite you to be part of it. <a href="https://www.itell.ai/#contacts">Request a demo for your company today</a>.<br>

    title: 'From Static Text to Living Stories: How Reading Learned to Talk',
    excerpt: 'A broken television led to a lifelong companionship with books and inspired the creation of iTELL, a platform designed to help all readers make texts come alive.',

    <b>From Static Text to Living Stories: How Reading Learned to Talk</b><br>
    <i>By Scott Crossley, iTELL Chief Innovation Officer</i><br><br>
    When I was three, the family television broke, and my parents decided not to replace it. 
    After that, all media came through the radio or through print. 
    Luckily, there were a lot of books in my house, and, at some point, I remember looking at a page and words suddenly appearing. 
    There were just a few at first, but then they started to multiply quickly, and my life was suddenly consumed by reading. 
    <br><br>
    This had a few positive outcomes. 
    First, while far from a star at school, I excelled at reading, 
    so much so that teachers questioned my parents about self-reports for the number of books I had read over the summer. 
    When it came to reading, I was a star. 
    Second, I found a connection with my father, spending innumerable number of nights at the city library with him. 
    Last, as the youngest child (by a long stretch) and as a child whose parents firmly believed in the law of grounding, 
    I spent a lot of time alone. It was at this time that books not only became a source of distraction and entertainment 
    but also companionship because the books started talking to me. 
    The main characters would come alive in my head and conversations and plots well beyond the printed word ensued.
    <br><br>
    Later, when studying for my Ph.D. and taking a course on reading theory, 
    I learned that this was natural and, was in a fact, a very good comprehension strategy. 
    Good readers do not treat texts as static entities devoid of character and emotion. 
    Instead, good readers interact with the texts they read. 
    This might be as simple as predicting what will happen next in a text, 
    elaborating on a plot, argument, or idea, or summarizing a text as it is read. 
    The best reading strategies, though, revolve around inferencing and involve readers making logical inferences 
    given within the text, between segments of texts, or between the text and their background knowledge. 
    Creating such inferences is known to improve text comprehension because readers are actively generating a mental 
    representation of a text to include the where, when, what, and how events unfold and who is involved.
    <br><br>
    Helping readers generate inferences is one of the main goals of iTELL. 
    iTELL does this by asking short questions that often require readers to make inferences and by assessing readers’ 
    summarization of text, which often leads to natural inferences. 
    iTELL also helps readers generate inferences through a dialogic chatbot called 
    Strategic Thinking And Interactive Reading Support (STAIRS). 
    STAIRS guides the reader through a self-explanation of a text chunk through conversational questions 
    designed to help the reader interact with the text. The STAIRS chatbot asks users to reread a section of text 
    and elaborate on that text, predict what will happen next in that text, 
    or make inferences or logical connections between segments of that text and/or a reader’s background knowledge. 
    <br><br>
    This is all done implicitly in iTELL because strong reading strategies occur naturally. 
    Additionally, we want iTELL users to focus on the reading demands of the text and not strategy development. 
    However, with experience and practice, strategies like inference generation can develop intuitively and reading skills 
    can develop naturally. Our hope is that iTELL helps texts become alive for all readers, 
    leading to a more engaging and rich learning experience. We know that texts can be companions, 
    and iTELL was developed to foster that relationship.
