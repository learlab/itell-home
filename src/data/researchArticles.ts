    title: 'Automated Scoring of Constructed Response Items in Math Assessment Using Large Language Models',
    excerpt: 'This study details a winning approach for automatically scoring math test responses using Large Language Models (LLMs). By balancing the training data and customizing the input for each question, their method achieved near-human levels of agreement with human scorers on nine out of ten test items.',

    title: 'Focus Time and Writing Performance in An Intelligent Textbook',
    excerpt: 'This study found that the more time students spend focused on an "intelligent textbook," the better they perform on subsequent writing assessments. This suggests that tracking reading focus time can be a useful metric for personalizing learning and understanding reading comprehension.',

    title: 'Using Intelligent Texts in a Computer Science Classroom: Findings from an iTELL Deployment',
    excerpt: 'This study found that an "intelligent text" system, which uses LLMs to provide feedback on student responses, helped computer science students learn more effectively than traditional texts. Students using the system showed greater learning gains, which were predicted by factors like their level of interaction and performance on the systems exercises.',

    title: 'Automatic Question Generation and Constructed Response Scoring in Intelligent Texts',
    excerpt: 'This study developed a pipeline using large language models (LLMs) to automatically generate questions and score student-written answers for "intelligent texts." They found that GPT-3.5 effectively created questions, while other models scored the answers, and participants in a trial reported a positive experience with the system.',
